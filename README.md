Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with Angular. The game allows two players to take turns clicking on cells in a 3x3 grid until one player gets three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or all cells are filled without any player getting three in a row.
Installation

To run the game, you will need to have Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your computer.

    Clone the repository to your local machine using the command git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git.

    Navigate to the project directory using the command cd tic-tac-toe.

    Install the required dependencies using the command npm install.

    Run the application using the command ng serve.

    Open a web browser and go to the URL http://localhost:4200 to play the game.

How to Play

    When the game starts, each player will be asked to enter their name.

    Player 1 will be assigned the symbol 'X', and Player 2 will be assigned the symbol 'O'.

    Players will take turns clicking on cells in the grid. To click on a cell, simply click on it with your mouse.

    The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

    If all cells are filled without any player getting three in a row, the game ends in a tie.

    After the game ends, a message will be displayed to indicate whether the game was won by a player or ended in a tie.

    Click the "Play Again" button to start a new game.

Leaderboard

The game keeps track of the number of wins for each player and displays a simple leaderboard at the bottom of the screen. The leaderboard shows each player's name and the number of games they have won.
