# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with Angular. The game allows two players to take turns clicking on cells in a 3x3 grid until one player gets three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or all cells are filled without any player getting three in a row.

## Installation

To run the game, you will need to have Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your computer.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git`.

2. Navigate to the project directory using the command `cd tic-tac-toe`.

3. Install the required dependencies using the command `npm install`.

4. Run the application using the command `ng serve`.

5. Open a web browser and go to the URL `http://localhost:4200` to play the game.

## How to Play

1. When the game starts, each player will be asked to enter their name.

2. Player 1 will be assigned the symbol 'X', and Player 2 will be assigned the symbol 'O'.

3. Players will take turns clicking on cells in the grid. To click on a cell, simply click on it with your mouse.

4. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

5. If all cells are filled without any player getting three in a row, the game ends in a tie.

6. After the game ends, a message will be displayed to indicate whether the game was won by a player or ended in a tie.

7. Click the "Play Again" button to start a new game.

## Leaderboard

The game keeps track of the number of wins for each player and displays a simple leaderboard at the bottom of the screen. The leaderboard shows each player's name and the number of games they have won.
